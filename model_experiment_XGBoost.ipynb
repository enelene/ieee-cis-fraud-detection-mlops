The final **robust pipeline**, incorporating preprocessing and the trained model, has been logged to MLflow and registered under the name `ieee_fraud_xgboost_pipeline`. This pipeline is designed to work directly on raw input data (after merging transaction/identity).\n",
    "# #\n",
    "# # **Next Steps:**\n",
    "# # 1.  Repeat this process for other model architectures (AdaBoost, GLM, Decision Tree, NN, etc.) by creating separate `model_experiment_{Architecture}.ipynb` notebooks, ensuring robust pipelines are used.\n",
    "# # 2.  Compare the `best_tuning_cv_auc` (or mean CV AUC if no tuning) across all registered models in the MLflow UI.\n",
    "# # 3.  Promote the best performing model version to \"Staging\" or \"Production\" in the MLflow Model Registry.\n",
    "# # 4.  Use the `model_inference.ipynb` notebook to load the production model from the registry and generate predictions on the competition's test set (feeding it the raw merged test data).\n",
